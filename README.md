## Overview

In today's world, many news articles carry some degree of biasâ€”whether intentional or not. This project tackles the challenge of biased reporting by aggregating news articles from diverse publishers and generating an unbiased article. The goal is to create comprehensive articles that fairly represent all viewpoints on a given topic.

## Features

### 1. **Ask Gemini**
Ask Gemini AI to clarify details or gain deeper insights into any part of a news article. This feature helps dispel misconceptions and ensures readers are well-informed.

### 2. **Political Leaning, Bias, and Tone Analysis**
Analyse how an article aligns with political spectrums (e.g., Democrat or Conservative in the US), assess its level of bias, and determine its tone (positive or negative).

### 3. **Search for Articles**

### 4. **Dark Mode**

## Future Improvements

1. Expand the range of news sources to include international publishers.
2. Introduce article categories such as Politics, Business, Technology, etc.
3. Enable users to input a news article link to generate an unbiased version of it.

## Running the Website

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask google-generativeai python-dotenv
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file and add your Gemini API key:

   ```plaintext
   GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   ```

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

## Updating the Server

1. Install additional dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn networkx
   ```

2. Add the following keys to your `.env` file:

   - [News API key](https://newsapi.org/)
   - [URL to Text API key](https://urltotext.com/)

   ```plaintext
   NEWS_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   URLTOTEXT_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   ```

3. Run `update_server.py`, followed by `update_server_2.py`.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python with Flask
- **Database:** SQL

## Credits

1. **Stack Overflow**
2. **ChatGPT**
3. **GitHub Copilot**

(Note: Don't worry, I built most of the project myself! These tools helped primarily with generating prompts for Gemini AI and some support in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I'm not too well-versed in those technologies.)

### Additional Details for Hack Club

I started this project before discovering Hack Club and had written a bunch of code that was not tracked by Hackatime because I had not installed the extension. However, I accidentally shipped it as a new project without realising there was an option to ship it as an update. Please refer to [this thread](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C07PZNMBPBN/p1736486246274139) for more details.
